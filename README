Each service gets its own directory under /etc/minit (change this in the
source, it's a #define right at the start of minit.c).

Each service directory can contain the following files/symlinks:

  depends

    a plain text file containing a service name per line.
    Example: /etc/minit/sshd/depends could contain "network".
    Each of these services will be started before this service is
    started.  If you need to wait for static initializations to
    complete, use the sync flag.

  run

    a symbolic link to the program name.  No hard link, because argv[0]
    for the programs is created by extracting the part after the last
    slash in the contents of the symbolic link.
    Example: "/usr/bin/sshd" would be run with argv[0]="sshd".

  params

    a plain text file containing command line parameters for the
    service, one parameter per line.  No shell expansion is done.  If
    you need shell expansion, have run point to a shell script instead
    of the real daemon.  Note: Have the shell script exec the daemon
    instead of simply running it to save system ressources.

  respawn

    touch this file to make minit respawn the process when it dies.
    This should be touched for getty and network servers.

  sync

    touch this file to make minit wait until the service ends.  sync is
    mutually exclusive with respawn.  This is meant for static
    initializations like "ifconfig".
