.TH serdo 1
.SH NAME
serdo \- run commands serially
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B serdo
.I [-c]
.I filename

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B serdo
will open the file given by the command line argument and serially
execute all the commands in it.  If a command fails, the whole batch job
is aborted (unless -c is given as first paramter on the serdo command
line).

serdo understands the \fBcd\fR, \fBexport\fR and \fBulimit\fR (set mode
only) sh(1) built-ins (no loops, no ~user expansion, no $FOO expansion,
no backticks).

serdo is very limited by design, but it is nice to have if you just want
to run a few ifconfig, ip, route commands in sequence.  serdo will
return the exit code of the last command it ran, 0 if none were given.

If no file name is given, but a file called "script" exists in the
current working directory, serdo will execute that file.  This saves a
few inodes in a typical /etc/minit tree.
