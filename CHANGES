0.9:
  For stopped services, minit did not record the time when it finished,
    but when it was started.
  add hard-reboot from Tommi Virtanen.  He also asked me to include an
    explicit license statement and sent a patch to make debian packaging
    easier (deb files can't include FIFOs).
  Olaf: add write_proc.

0.8:
  call waitpid repeatedly until it returns "no children".
  This reaps zombies faster.

0.7:
  found and fixed the bug that made the logging support not work when
    minit was running as PID 1.
  saw that the shutdown from sysvinit actually does what it's supposed
    to do, even with minit, if one uses the -n mode.  It should be quite
    easy to write a nice and clean shutdown for minit now.
  if a service depends on a service that already finished, don't start
    it again.

0.6.1:
  fixed msvc and minit handling of msvc -P.
  pidfilehack has now actually been tested and works with ssh.

0.6:
  add tty and session leadership magic and I actually got getty to work
    as init on my laptop, i.e. in production use!
  add msvc man page.

0.5.1:
  cut&paste error, set wrong variable to 0 for keyboard request.
    Thanks, Schulti.

0.5:
  add "log" subdirectory (see README).
  get rid of stdio and *printf and switch to routines from libowfat.

0.4:
  add pidfilehack.  It will take the first argument as filename for the
  PID file (i.e. /var/run/sshd.pid), the second argument as service name
  for minit (i.e. ssh) and the rest of the command line is run without
  path searching in a child process.  The parent process will then
  try to open the pidfile several times (for up to 30 seconds), read the
  PID off it and run msvc to tell minit the PID of the service.  minit
  can then track sshd and restart it if necessary.  This gross hack does
  not work for daemons that do not write a PID file, but there are not
  many of those, fortunately.
