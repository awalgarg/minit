0.6.1:
  fixed msvc and minit handling of msvc -P.
  pidfilehack has now actually been tested and works with ssh.

0.6:
  add tty and session leadership magic and I actually got getty to work
    as init on my laptop, i.e. in production use!
  add msvc man page.

0.5.1:
  cut&paste error, set wrong variable to 0 for keyboard request.
    Thanks, Schulti.

0.5:
  add "log" subdirectory (see README).
  get rid of stdio and *printf and switch to routines from libowfat.

0.4:
  add pidfilehack.  It will take the first argument as filename for the
  PID file (i.e. /var/run/sshd.pid), the second argument as service name
  for minit (i.e. ssh) and the rest of the command line is run without
  path searching in a child process.  The parent process will then
  try to open the pidfile several times (for up to 30 seconds), read the
  PID off it and run msvc to tell minit the PID of the service.  minit
  can then track sshd and restart it if necessary.  This gross hack does
  not work for daemons that do not write a PID file, but there are not
  many of those, fortunately.
